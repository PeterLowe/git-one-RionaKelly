Init
git init creates a new repository in the folder that Git Bash is launched in
 

A hidden .git folder is created that contains this repository
 
 
Add
git add adds files to the directory, I will use git add . to add all the new files, we can see that all the files are added using the “git status” command that I will go over next
 

 
Status
“git status” will list all the files in the directory, modified files will be red and added files will be green
 
After using git add .
 
 
Commit
git commit creates a new commit, commits are snapshots of the repository at different times, I will use git commit -m “init, add, status, commit written” to create a new commit and leave a suitable comment
 
 
Remote
git remote add <name> <url> adds a new repository
  
git remote -v lists the remote repositories
 
 
Push
git push updates the remote node with the current node
  
Branch
git branch creates a new branch in the local repository, the term after branch will be the branch name
 
git branch --list will list all the branches in the repository
 
 
Log
git log displays the entire commit history, you can press <space> for more or <q> to quit
 


Log cont.
git log --stat shows the files altered and the lines that have been changed
git log --graph will drawn the branch paths
git log –(n) will only display the last (n) commits
I will put all the screenshots here and smaller because they take up a lot of space but I want to get all the information in
    
Stash
git stash makes a local copy of the current working directory 
git stash list lists all the previously pushed stashes
git pop retrieves stash {0} (the last stash of the edited files) and copies the files into a working directory, numbers other than {0} can be retrieved with git apply stash {(n)}
 
Remove/Rm
git rm deletes files
Here I delete my old pdf file so that it doesn't cause any problems since I’ll have to make a new one later
